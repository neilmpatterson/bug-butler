# Bug Butler Configuration File
#
# This file defines how to connect to Jira and what SLA rules to apply
# for monitoring bugs.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to config.yaml: cp config.sample.yaml config.yaml
# 2. Update the jira section with your Jira instance details
# 3. Set JIRA_API_TOKEN environment variable with your API token
# 4. Customize SLA rules to match your team's requirements

# Jira connection settings
jira:
  # Your Jira Cloud base URL
  base_url: "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net"

  # Your Jira email address
  email: "your-email@company.com"

  # Jira API token - uses environment variable interpolation
  # Generate token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
  # Set in your shell: export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"
  api_token: "${JIRA_API_TOKEN}"

  # Jira project keys to monitor (supports multiple projects)
  # Use array format for multiple projects
  project_keys:
    - "PROJ1"
    - "PROJ2"

  # Alternatively, for a single project:
  # project_key: "MYPROJECT"

# SLA rules define thresholds for bug age based on priority and status
# Rules are evaluated in order (first-match wins)
# Bugs that violate rules are grouped into buckets for display
sla_rules:
  # Critical bugs need immediate triage (within 6 hours)
  - name: "Critical bugs need immediate triage"
    priority: "Critical"
    status: ["Needs Triage", "To Do"]
    max_age_days: 0.25  # 6 hours
    bucket: "🔴 URGENT"
    severity: 1

  # Critical bugs shouldn't sit in backlog (within 6 hours)
  - name: "Critical bugs stuck in backlog"
    priority: "Critical"
    status: ["Backlog", "Bug Fix Needed"]
    max_age_days: 0.25
    bucket: "🔴 URGENT"
    severity: 1

  # High priority bugs need timely triage (within 1 day)
  - name: "High priority needs triage"
    priority: "High"
    status: ["Needs Triage"]
    max_age_days: 1
    bucket: "🟡 ATTENTION NEEDED"
    severity: 2

  # High priority bugs shouldn't age in backlog (within 3 days)
  - name: "High priority backlog aging"
    priority: "High"
    status: ["Backlog", "Bug Fix Needed", "On Hold", "To Do"]
    max_age_days: 3
    bucket: "🟡 ATTENTION NEEDED"
    severity: 2

  # Medium priority bugs need review within 3 weeks
  - name: "Medium priority stale"
    priority: "Medium"
    status: ["Backlog", "Needs Triage", "To Do", "Bug Fix Needed", "On Hold"]
    max_age_days: 21
    bucket: "⚪ REVIEW NEEDED"
    severity: 3

  # Low priority bugs that have been sitting too long (30 days)
  - name: "Low priority very stale"
    priority: "Low"
    status: ["Backlog", "Needs Triage", "To Do", "Bug Fix Needed", "On Hold"]
    max_age_days: 30
    bucket: "⚪ REVIEW NEEDED"
    severity: 3

# Statistics configuration for bug trend analysis
# Used by the 'bug-butler stats' command
stats:
  # Target reduction percentage for monthly bug creation goal
  # Default: 10.0 (aim for 10% fewer bugs than same month last year)
  reduction_goal_percent: 10.0

  # Number of months to analyze for trend statistics
  # Default: 24 (last 2 years)
  months_to_analyze: 24

# Configuration Notes:
# - Priority values should match your Jira priority names exactly (case-sensitive)
# - Status can be a single string or array of strings (OR logic)
# - Status values are case-sensitive and must match your Jira instance
# - max_age_days supports decimals (e.g., 0.25 = 6 hours, 0.5 = 12 hours)
# - Buckets group violations; same bucket name = same display table
# - Severity determines bucket display order (1 = highest priority)
